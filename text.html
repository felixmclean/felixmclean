<LI>Bostrom makes an offhanded reference of the possibility of a dictatorless dystopia, one that every single citizen including the leadership hates but which nevertheless endures unconquered. It’s easy enough to imagine such a state. Imagine a country with two rules: first, every person must spend eight hours a day giving themselves strong electric shocks. Second, if anyone fails to follow a rule (including this one), or speaks out against it, or fails to enforce it, all citizens must unite to kill that person. Suppose these rules were well-enough established by tradition that everyone expected them to be enforced. So you shock yourself for eight hours a day, because you know if you don’t everyone else will kill you, because if they don’t, everyone else will kill them, and so on.</LI>

<LI>Social media & the press are currently incentivized to drastically exaggerate narratives of division.</LI>
<LI>Go to college so I can work a 9-5 job that I like for about a year, but then I get sick of it. I make enough money to attract pretty girls but not enough to attract romantic ones. I'm in a dead end marriage that im afraid to end, and im pretty sure my wife is cheating on me. Our children grew up to be weak minded on account of over exposure to social media, they lack ambition. I am beginning to lose faith in my country as I see  legislatures slowly hacking away at our rights and freedoms. One of my children became sick, and died.</LI>
